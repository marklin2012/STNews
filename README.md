A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## 如何运行

目前本项目没有对 null-safety 做处理， 所以需要增加参数设置才能运行项目

```
flutter run --no-sound-null-safety

```

如果需要在 VSCode 中运行的话需要在设置中找到 `Flutter Run Additional Args`， 然后增加 `--no-sound-null-safety` 即可运行。
